This is a sample project with Nuxt to demostrate my project [apihero](https://apihero.quixtools.com/).

apihero is a free REST service built to empower developers, testers, and educators by providing easy access to ready-to-use RESTful API endpoints. Whether you're prototyping a frontend application, testing HTTP requests, learning frontend frameworks or just working on your portfolio project, apihero offers a lightweight, hassle-free backend alternative to support your workflow.
